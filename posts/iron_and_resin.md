* Made in the USA

### Iron and resin
<p>
Born in a small, Southern California, blue-collar beach town, graced with world class point breaks and seaside racetracks, where ghosts of a once towering oil industry still linger in the shadows. Iron & Resin is the brainchild of several friends who, after decades of collective experience building successful clothing brands, decided to turn back the clock and start anew. The result is a small, hand built collection of goods that draws heavily upon the founder’s own lifestyles and experiences. 

Forged in California...In a mass produced, disposable world, Iron & Resin is a product of "one-off" culture. Where men still build, by their own hands, the craft they ride, be it water or land.
