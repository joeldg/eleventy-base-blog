### Joe McCoy
<p><i>The same company as The Real McCoy's</i></p>

<p>Taking it’s cues from each changing era of the American experience in Sportswear, Denim and Workwear, Joe McCoy continues to manufacture unchanging products designed to last generations.

When unraveling the cultural history woven together on the American continent, the singular contribution of one legendary figure comes quickly to mind, Joseph Getting McCoy. As the son of immigrants, Joe McCoy combined the traditions of his parents with ideas born of the the new world. he rode the mid-nineteenth century frontier wave eastward to frame with his innovate and tough brand of textiles. The arrival of work pants reinforced with copper rivets heralded the dawn of the new era. 

In the early twentieth century, motorisation, prosperity and strong demand for durable goods and luxuries rapidly spread across the country. Labourers wanted tough and affordable workwear. Gatsbyian playboys wanted suits and coats of the finest materials. Not many years later this deepening polarity gave way to a bubble-bursting depression and world-changing war, followed by a radical shift in clothing needs. 

The garment industry was revolutionised as government contracts poured in for innovative and functional clothing. When the dust settled, American garments were recognised round the world for their function and originality.
