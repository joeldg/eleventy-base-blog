<strong>H.H. note:</strong><i>Lightweight very comfortable hoodie that fits nicely, it's  one of my favorites for summer nights, I bought one randomly at the SeaTac Airport. They have other <a href='https://www.alternativeapparel.com/mens-clothing/tops/hoodies'>'regular' hoodies</a> made of a heavier version of the same material but given the polyester percentage, this listing is for the lightweight version.</i>
