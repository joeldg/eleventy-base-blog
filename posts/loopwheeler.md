### Loopwheeler

<p><i>translated description</i></p>

<p>"World's best, legitimate sweatshirt". From such thought LOOPWHEELER started in 1999. Only the "comfortable" hanging knittings produced by hands of craftsmen with skilled skills are disseminated to the world. Why is it possible? Experienced craftsmen with hanging knitting machines and sewing. And it is because there is solid technical force and production factory in the background born from bonds with people engaged in all processes. Producing sweat wear of the maid in Japan to be proud of, we continue to create a new world view of hanging fabrics as they are originally. "Hanging knitting machine" was a very common knitting machine to produce sweatshirt fabric until mid-1960. The greatest feature of the finished fabric is "softness", which is summarized in this word. 

The characteristics of the hanging knitted fabric, whose characteristics are not easily lost even when repeatedly washed as a training wear as a clothing nearest to the human skin, was optimal as a material for sweatshirts and T-shirts. However, in times of mass production and mass consumption also arrive in clothing, this hanging knitting machine gradually disappears as efficiency production-oriented production system is built. For example, "hanging fleece" can only knit 1 meter per hour, and craftsmen are constantly working while adjusting the knitting machine, so many factories will introduce the latest computerized knitting machine So we increased production efficiency. There are currently about 400 hanging knitting machines in Wakayama, Japan, of which about 200 are in operation. Production processes while requiring skilled skills (knitting, repairing, maintenance, etc.) may certainly be extremely inefficient. However, here is the attitude of making a real thing. Sweatshirts and T-shirts that casually pass through the sleeves every day, I will complete the "best fit" of items which are the closest to this skin through the best process in materials, design, patterns and sewing. Sweatshirts made before the 60 's are loved as a vintage item beyond the times. These fabrics using hanging knitting machines can keep on wearing without losing even for long-time use. 

It is possible to keep one taste comfortable, leave its taste to the next generation without losing its texture for many years. And for that reason, we will keep the background of the production site in the future. Here we are, the reason why LOOPWHEELER aims to become "the world's best, legitimate sweatshirt" and walks.</p>
