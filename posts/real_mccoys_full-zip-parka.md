### The Real McCoy's
<p>The Real McCoy's is a brand like no other. To many the outdated features of vintage clothing have little significance in today's modern society, but this is exactly what influences the brand. American fashion of the 1940's and 1950's is a source of great inspiration; a young country unburdened by the restrictions of traditional customs, one that’s uninhibited, rational and innovative.</p>

<p>However, this ideology is not enough. To make extraordinary clothing with vintage details and twists requires the sensitive minds and outstanding work of craftsmen in Japan. They are highly skilled at manufacturing materials using the same methods and machinery from the past. Whilst they endeavor to create the very best reproduction, they also seek to make it even better than the original.</p>
