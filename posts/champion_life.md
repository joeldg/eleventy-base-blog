### Champion - part of HanesBrands
<p>HanesBrands is a socially responsible manufacturer and marketer of leading everyday basic apparel under some of the world's strongest apparel brands in the Americas, Europe and Asia, as well as in Australia and South Africa. Our iconic innerwear and activewear apparel brands found in the United States and elsewhere include Hanes, Champion, Playtex, Bali, Maidenform, JMS/Just My Size, Wonderbra and Gear for Sports. Outside the United States, we also have dominant national and regional brands, including DIM, Nur Die/Nur Der, Lovable, Abanderado, Shock Absorber, Zorba, Sol y Oro, Rinbros, Track N Field and Ritmo.

We are the world’s largest marketer of basic apparel. We sell bras, panties, shapewear, sheer hosiery, men's underwear, children's underwear, socks, T-shirts, sweatshirts, fleece and other activewear. In the United States, we sell more units of intimate apparel, male underwear, socks, shapewear, hosiery and T-shirts than any other company.

Founded in 1901, Hanes has a long history of innovation, product excellence, and brand recognition. In fact, nearly 90 percent of U.S. households have our company's products in them. We revolutionized Tagless T-shirts and underwear, we invented the sports bra and the stretch-cup T-shirt bra, we were the first to advertise a bra on national television (Playtex), and we are innovating with ComfortBlend and temperature-control X-Temp fabrics and seamless Smart Sizes bras.

Our Sell More, Spend Less and Make Acquisitions strategies are driving growth and creating value for our shareholders, consumers, retailers, employees and communities. Hanes has made more than a half dozen acquisitions, including Maidenform Brands, Gear for Sports and Knights Apparel in the United States and DBApparel in Europe.

Based in Winston-Salem, N.C., Hanes is a member of the S&P 500 and is ranked No. 490 on the Fortune 500 list. The company has approximately 65,300 employees in more than 40 countries.

Unlike most apparel companies, Hanes primarily operates its own manufacturing facilities. More than 90 percent of the apparel units that we sell worldwide and in the United States are manufactured in our own plants or those of dedicated contractors. ﻿</p>
