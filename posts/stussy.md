### Stussy
<p>
In 1980, Shawn Stussy was a local cult surfboard shaper who took his scrawled signature logo from his foam masterpieces and applied it to tee shirts that he sold with his boards around Laguna Beach, California.

As the clothing line expanded, it's raw and modern aesthetic soon developed into the next generation of new wave beach culture. We grew during a time when epochal shifts which eternally framed contemporary popular culture were taking place.

In the music scene, the late 70's gave us punk. Then the early 80's brought us into the new DIY music called rap. Punk broke creative and aesthetic barriers and taught us that anyone could have a band. Rap then preceded not only to push social boundaries but as well explore the ideas of remixing and sampling. These new ideas and territories created a new modern platform for fashion and cultural expression.

With Stussy's success came the opportunity to travel and spread the Stussy vibe. We hooked up with trendsetters in New York, London, Tokyo and other areas of the world. Stussy clothing was inspired by this international group of musicians, skaters, DJs and artists with similar tastes, which helped to shape the brand into an international streetwear label.

Today, Stussy exists as a brand with worldwide respect and independence. With over sixty stores across the globe and a very strong tribe still in effect, Stussy is a leader in the culture which we helped start almost 30 years ago.
