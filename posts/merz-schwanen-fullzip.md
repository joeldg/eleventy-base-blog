<p>This hooded jacket never lets you down!

Proper material, solid haptics and a useful zip make this your favorite garment for all those really good moments.

The useful hood, robust, but soft material and the triangular patches under the arms guarantee a natural fit and maximum comfort. The 3-count organic-cotton is soft to the touch and mild to the skin. At the same time, the durable material will impress you with its haptic feel.</p>
