<strong>H.H. note:</strong><i>This is a warm hoodie for cold climates, it is 2x layers of 13oz 100% cotton fleece with a really big hood. To state the obvious, it's the heaviest hoodie I've ever found at 5.8 pounds.</i>

These heavyweight sweatshirts are made with two layers of thick, 13 oz.  pre-shrunk 100% cotton fleece for warmth, and gusseted armpits for freedom of movement. The full zip front extends past the chin for added coverage in colder weather. We also added an interior zip pocket and two vertical hand warmer pockets. The oversized hood fits over a hard hat or helmet, making this warm full zip heavyweight sweatshirt the perfect choice for when you’re on the job or out doing your thing.

Arborwear Sweatshirts are cut for a streamlined fit.  Designed so excess fabric won't get in your way, the fit allows for a maximum range of motion and is very comfortable.  While other sweatshirts shrink down after a dozen trips to the laundry, our Sweatshirts will exhibit very little, if any residual shrinkage after washing.  

Arborwear Double Thick Sweatshirts may feel tight as you pull them on as the Double Thick layers of Cotton Fleece don't stretch quite as much as our Single Thick style.  Once on, our Double Thick Sweatshirt will loosen up. If you prefer the fit of a big, baggy sweatshirt, we recommend you order up one size.

* 2 Layers of 13 oz. Pre-Washed, 100% Cotton Fleece
* Oversized, 3-Piece Hood
* Underarm Gussets
* Full Front Beefy YKK® Zipper
* Interior Zip Pocket
* Vertical, Recessed Handwarmer Pockets

### Arborwear
<p>We started as arborists — folks that take care of trees. Back then, there were two types of pants for tree work: canvas work pants or rock climbing pants. Canvas pants were too stiff, never fit very well and restricted our movement. Rock climbing pants on the other hand, allowed free movement, but sure didn't hold up well to tree work… Not to mention they cost an arm and a leg.

Our solution was to marry the two and make a comfortable canvas work pant that you could actually move in. A pant that fit well, held up on the job, and cost less than a case of bar oil. After many prototypes and on-the-job testing, we finally made some things we liked. Truth is, we found other folks liked them too — not just arborists. The features that make our clothes great for tree work are the same for any demanding work environment or lifestyle. We're not about bells and whistles… just the necessities that work.

Making honest, hardworking clothing remains our passion. Each of our innovative, free-moving designs are made using heavy-duty fabrics. We don't test our clothes in some fancy lab…. But personally from the tops of trees to dragging brush on the ground. The result is something you can trust day in and day out. Put yours to the test the same way we do — one leg at a time.
