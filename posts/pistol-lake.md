**100% ORGANIC COTTON**

Naturally soft, premium 6oz 100% organic cotton. It’s the fabric we built our company on and is the first we ever developed. It’s grown in a natural, pesticide-free process that drastically reduces water and soil pollution.


**PERFECT FIT**

With the help and feedback of countless customers, we've made hundreds of revisions to perfect the fit of our clothes. We garment dye, launder, and pre-shrink everything we make. It won't lose it's shape, color, or shrink in the wash.


**MADE IN THE USA**

We wanted to bring back the level of craftsmanship that for so long defined American manufacturing. We hand-sew to last and take great pride in our ethical, sustainable manufacturing processes. This means everyone we work with is treated fairly, paid a living wage, and takes as much pride in crafting our products as we do.

### Pistol Lake
<p>
We started Pistol Lake in 2012 to make a small difference in the world.

We wanted to bring back the level of craftsmanship that for so long defined American manufacturing.

We strive for perfection in everything we make.

Here’s why we’re doing what we’re doing:

1. We believe through ethical manufacturing we can create well-paying jobs for people that need them most.

2. By developing recycled fabrics we can lessen the impact of manufacturing on the world.

3. By developing ultra-functional gear with a natural aesthetic, we can simplify but do more.

Thank you so much for the support, and allowing us to do what we love to do. ﻿</p>
