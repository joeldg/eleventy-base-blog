<strong>H.H. note:</strong><i>Reigning Champ is one of those brands that gets a lot of airplay. Their standard lightweight hoodies are great at keeping you cool, and the mid-weight will keep you comfortable, but where RC shines is their bonded interlock 100% cotton series, it is exceptionally fine material (both linked below). All the flatlock seams and little details like the two-way YKK zippers on all pieces is a major plus.</i>
