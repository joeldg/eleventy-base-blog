### Mollusk
<p>
We design custom “cut & sew” garments, so you get fit and quality built from the ground up. From our tees to boardshorts, none of our logos are just slapped on a blank, but are designed in San Francisco and crafted in Oakland or Los Angeles. Some of our products that contain wool are made in Peru, and are mentioned on our hangtags and website.
