<strong>H.H. note:</strong><i>These say they fit big, I somehow doubt that. These are one of the few loopwheeled cotton hoodies I can find available online in size XL because of the price.</i>

</p>    
The Hooded Pullover Sweatshirt  from OrSlow has been made from Japanese cotton, woven on a vintage loop-wheel machine. This slow process takes away tension from the fabric leaving it with a soft fleece on the inside and an overall unique fabric. It also features a raglan sleeve for added comfort.

The resulting material feels like it has been hand woven, with a stretchy element to it, a quality that cannot be replicated by modern production techniques. The crucial difference is that Loopwheel textiles is knit in an oval shaped sequence to yield a fabric that will comfortably stretch with wear, but will return to its original dimensions with a wash.

These sweatshirts will shrink around 5% in width after a cold wash with minimal shrinkage in length. Best to lay flat to dry.

*Please note these fit big so you may want to size down from your usual*
