### Todd Snyder
<p>Iowa native Todd Snyder makes effortless everyday luxuries for the modern gentleman. Blending Savile Row craftsmanship with a downtown New York aesthetic, the line is relaxed, refined and always impeccably tailored.

The collections are informed by heritage yet updated for today, with an emphasis on versatility and comfort. Suit jackets work as well with jeans as with a matching trouser; shirting can get dressed up or down; and sport-inspired casual wear is built for utility and style. Every garment reflects a commitment to quality and integrity, as well as the belief that well-made, perfectly fitted clothes make the man.

Snyder has been named one of GQ’s Best New Menswear Designers, a CFDA Menswear Designer of the Year nominee, and a CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund Finalist. He studied textile and clothing design at Iowa State University before training at Badowers, the renowned Des Moines haberdashery, and held important roles at Polo Ralph Lauren, the Gap, and J.Crew.

A strong proponent of American heritage design, Snyder launched the Todd Snyder + Champion label in partnership with the iconic athletic brand, and recently added a women’s collection. Snyder continues to collaborate with like-minded legacy brands including Timex, PF Flyers, Moscot, and Cole Haan.

Todd Snyder is available online and at department stores and boutiques in the U.S. and around the globe, including the Townhouse, the brand’s first concept store in Shibuya, Tokyo, and the Library, a second space in Osaka. The brand’s first Flagship store opened in New York’s Madison Square Park December 2016.</p>
