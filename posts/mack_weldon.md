### Mack Weldon
<p>
We founded Mack Weldon because we wanted more out of our basics and always questioned how something so essential could be such a pain in the a** to buy?


The frustration was real and our “eureka moment” happened in a department store aisle full of brands that dominated our top drawer. Surrounded by a mind-numbing assortment of underwear and socks, we realized consistent fit and quality became a game of roulette… so we decided to take matters into our own hands.


We started from scratch and engineered our own fabric. We made sure the design process was meticulous so you can count on the fit being the same each time. We built a world class customer experience. The difference is in the details so we obsessed over every stitch and seam until we’d reached our definition of perfect.
