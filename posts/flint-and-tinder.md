<strong>H.H. note:</strong><i> From a kickstarter, this heavyweight hoodie came to the world.

The description below (from their site) lists the fabric as 23 oz fleece, which I believe is a typo and should say 13 oz fleece which is borderline heavy. Or perhaps that the whole thing is 23oz. I know it's not 23oz/yard fleece because if it was true 23oz fleece the hoodie would weight in at somewhere over 7lbs and would be suitable for the arctic circle.

Because of a few extras like the media pocket, this hoodie edges out the American Giant to enter the mid-tier

#### Story
A 10-Year investment in your closet. A 10-Year investment in America.

Flint and Tinder is an American brand, through and through, and the 10-Year Hoodie is a truly American product, passing through the hands of 20+ American workers on its journey to your doorstep. The uncompromising construction starts with a beefy 23 oz fleece from South Carolina, heavy-duty zippers from Georgia and twill tape from Philadelphia. It’s all expertly cut, sewn and washed in Los Angeles into a premium sweatshirt that’ll grow with you, the way your favorite sweatshirt should — softer with wear and backed by the stories of a decade. And you’ll love the fit. We guarantee it.

#### Features
Building off the success of their record-breaking Kickstarter, our brothers at Flint and Tinder rebuilt the 10-Year Hoodie from the ground up. They switched to a beefy yet insanely comfortable fabric. They upgraded the metal hardware. They perfected the structured fit. Other highlights include:

* Structured and flattering fit
* Double-lined hood keeps out the cold
* Secret inside media pocket for your phone or wallet
* Metal-tipped drawcords
* Each reinforced seam carefully considered for durability

#### Materials

* Cotton from the Mississippi Delta
* 23 oz extra soft fleece from South Carolina
* Twill-reinforced seams made in Philadelphia
* Fabric is a soft yet durable blend of 70% cotton / 30% poly
* Heavy-duty zippers machined in Georgia
* Cut, sewn, and finished in Los Angeles

#### The 10-Year Guarantee
Every stitch tells a story. As the years go on, your hoodie will become more comfortable, recognizable and unique to you. We've made our 10-Year Hoodie to last for the next decade, so if your hoodie rips, tears, or otherwise comes apart at the seams, let us know and we’ll repair it.
