### Wings+Horns
<p>Dual perspectives are essential to wings+horns. We are a designer and a manufacturer, with roots in Canada and Japan.

In 2004, after nearly a decade spent developing fabrics and producing apparel for the Japanese market, we opened a factory in Vancouver, BC, where we make our collections to this day.

Our designs balance a modern perspective natural to the Pacific Northwest with an ingrained value of technique, discipline and detail.

We combine premium materials with a forward-thinking focus on simplicity and precision, and aim to elevate classic design through a mastery of process. ﻿</p>
