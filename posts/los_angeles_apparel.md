6. We Support Domestic Farmers and The Domestic Yarn Industry
We strive to buy textile and yarn products made in the United States to support domestic manufacturing. Over half of our yarn consumption will be derived from domestic sources. A strong domestic industry is good for our company’s financial viability in the long run. It helps us serve the interests of our customers, is good for the health of the domestic and continental manufacturing base, and ultimately is good for the environment by reducing the impact of our supply chain’s carbon footprint.

We strive to integrate the following to our supply chain: 1. Environmentally friendly grown cotton or organic cotton. 2. Recycled or reclaimed cotton.

8.We Recycle
We plan to recycle almost 100 percent of our waste by 2018. We also use advanced manufacturing to reduce waste by products during our production process.

9.Environmentally-friendly Dyeing and Finishing
California has the most stringent environmental protection rules imposed on the industry of dyeing. By dyeing and finishing almost all of our textiles or garments in California, you are assured our fabric processing is environmentally friendly.

10.We Support Free Trade
We are not nationalists. We support worldwide free trade. We believe we can compete globally and still produce value for our customers while remaining true to our sustainability and efficiency commitment. We want to sell our products to the world and we understand the importance of other countries having access to our market.
