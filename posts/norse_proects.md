### Norse Projects
<p>Norse Projects is philosophically rooted in Scandinavia with a Danish design aesthetic, and the idea that good design is functional and timeless in nature. Within roots in street culture, skateboarding and inspiration from architecture and the subtle landscapes of the North, Norse Projects creates European sourced and sewn garments for the modern man. ﻿

Home of Norse Projects and Norse Projects Women, the Norse Stores are situated in the heart of Copenhagen, tucked away in a small street by the King's Gardens. 

In 2015 Norse Store Women opened next to the original Norse Store offering the complete Norse Projects Women's line along with a tightly curated selection of like-minded and complementary brands and accessories.

With a passion for functionality, quality, the classics and the ultra modern. We specialise in blending traditional work and outdoor pieces with the avant-garde, Japanese specialty products and technical outerwear.
