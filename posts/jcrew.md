<strong>H.H. note:</strong><i>J.Crew is a classic sportswear brand. This is the online only version French Terry which looks good, but don't seem to have larger sizes in stock. </i>

Our designers went back to the basics to create this no-brainer zip hoodie, then they gave it an upgrade in our incredibly soft vintage fleece. Like the classic style (after all, it's been a wardrobe staple for decades), it has a drawstring hood, a large pocket and a hardy zipper opening.

* Cotton/poly.
* Drawstring hood.
* Zip closure.
* Rib trim at cuffs and hem.
* Slant pockets.
* Machine wash.
* Import.
* Online only.

### J.Crew
<p>WE SIDE WITH STYLE OVER FASHION, think 
timelessness is underrated and find that clothes look 
best when they’re lived in. WE LOVE COLOR-
BLOCKING AND PATTERN MIXING and temper
tomboy with heels. WE’RE FANS OF TOUSLED
HAIR and think everything’s right when something’s left
just a little imperfect. WE WEAR SNEAKERS WITH
SUITS, wing tips with jeans and chambray on chambray.
WE DON’T BELIEVE THERE’S SUCH A THING
AS OVERDRESSED—and we don’t rent tuxedos.
WE’RE AN AMERICAN BRAND, but we source
fabrics from around the world: Japanese seersucker,
Irish linen and Italian wool. WE DON’T BELIEVE
THERE’S JUST ONE WAY TO WEAR AN OUTFIT,
but we do have a few ideas on how to pull one together.
FOR US, THE MAGIC IS IN THE MIX. ﻿</p>
