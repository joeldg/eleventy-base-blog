<p>This classic hoody been updated with a new fabric finish that gives it a plush feel, heightening the luxuriousness of this style. Part of our matching track set, the refined new hoody bears all the hallmarks of the classic style including a neat, classic fit , rib cuffs and zip closure.

‘Loopback’ is the technical term given to the fabric traditionally used to make sweatshirts. It’s a literal description of the construction of the fabric that features loops on its reverse and is also a reference to the original machine that was used to knit the fabric: the loopwheel.

Having originally been developed for sports garments, the loops on the back of the fabric were designed to absorb sweat from your body, passing it into the garment to keep you cool. Conversely, our loopback fabric is designed to trap warm air inside, providing an insulating layer for day-to-day wear.

### Sunspel
<p>Sunspel is a manufacturer of luxury everyday clothing. It’s what we’ve done since 1860 and remains at the heart of everything we do today. From the very beginning it has been our ambition to make clothes to the highest possible standard and to offer true value.

Being a manufacturer allows us to innovate in textile development. Our famous Q14 cellular fabric was created in 1937. The underwear made from this distinctive looking fabric with the little holes remains some of our best-selling and best-loved products.

Today, our factory in Long Eaton, where we’ve been based since 1937, remains a vital part of Sunspel. Having our own dedicated team of craftspeople means that our designers can execute their vision in the most exacting and precise manner possible. Our Loopback fabric and sweatshirt were developed here in 2011 and take pride of place as some our greatest recent innovations.

Where appropriate we work with the very best manufacturers overseas in countries such as Turkey or Portugal. We only work with those that have the same values of craftsmanship and quality as we do. Often the processes and techniques for our key garments have been developed in Long Eaton before our manufacturers abroad use them.

Wherever we manufacture, our aim of making luxury everyday clothing remains unchanged. It’s held us in good stead since 1860 and will do so, hopefully, long into the future.</p>
