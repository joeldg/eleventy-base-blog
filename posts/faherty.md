### Faherty
<p>
Our life-long dream has been to create clothing for life's great moments, the ones spent by the water, around a bonfire, catching waves or watching sunrises. It's what makes the morning commute, the boss you don't like, and the pile of work on your desk not so bad. We're proud to design clothing made from unique and sustainable fabrics, and develop close, personal relationships with our manufacturers to craft high quality goods. You'll often find us in one of our six shops around the country, be it in SoHo and West Village, NY; Boston and Nantucket, MA; or Malibu and Newport Beach, CA. If you're in the area, swing by and say hi. It's our customers and community that give this brand life.
