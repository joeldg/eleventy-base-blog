### John Elliott
<p>JOHN ELLIOTT WAS FORMED IN THE SPRING OF 2012 AS A CONCEPT WITH MY BEST FRIEND AND BUSINESS PARTNER, AARON LAVEE. WE DELIVERED OUR FIRST SEASON IN THE SPRING OF 2013. IT HAS BEEN A LIFELONG PASSION PROJECT. THE BRAND IS THE RESULT OF ME SOLVING THE PROBLEMS I HAD WITH MY OWN WARDROBE. I STARTED WITH BASIC CATEGORIES AND FOCUSED ON CREATING FUNCTIONAL YET MODERN FITS WITH UNIQUE FABRICS. WE PAY ATTENTION TO DETAILS THAT MATTER. OUR FRENCH TERRY IS CUSTOM KNIT IN THE UNITED STATES TO OUR SPECIFICATIONS. OUR ZIPPERS ARE SOURCED FROM RIRI IN SWITZERLAND. WE TRAVEL TO JAPAN TO SOURCE AND DEVELOP FABRICS. WE ARE AT OUR PRODUCTION FACILITY IN LOS ANGELES EVERY DAY OVERSEEING THE PROCESS.

AS WE GROW, WE STRIVE TO REMEMBER WHERE WE'VE BEEN AND WHO WE ARE AS A COMPANY, WHILE ALSO PUSHING FORWARD TO CONSTANTLY INNOVATE AND IMPROVE. WE REINVEST IN OUR PRODUCTS IN THE HOPE OF CREATING TOMORROW'S CLASSICS.</p>
