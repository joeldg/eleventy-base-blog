<strong>H.H. note:</strong><i> American Giant went crazy on blogs and the online hype went way way overboard. They claim that this is the "greatest hoodie ever made" and if you are on this site, you know that unless they are loopwheeled cotton that simply is just not going to be the case. Additionally the lack of a 2-way zipper, that even a cheap-o Uniqlo has, is a huge oversight.

These hoodies are nice and heavy 13oz fabric and I enjoy wearing mine. AG are the absolute top of the 'low-end' and really deserve to be in the mid-tier but now everyone and their uncle has one of these and some of the missing features have dropped them down in my ranking.</i>

### American Giant
<p>American Giant is an apparel company founded
on an audacious idea: that innovation and
enterprise belong to all of us. Not just Silicon
Valley. We’re investing in technology and
engineering to produce the best of American
Made classics--and reignite manufacturing towns
with new jobs along the way.

The apparel industry faces overwhelming competition from abroad.
Some cheaper and faster. Some state of the art. If manufacturing is
going to survive here, we have to be smarter. Work harder. Create a
better product. We’ve assembled a supply chain of people and
materials built to do just that.

We’re inspired by the best of classic American style.
We take iconic pieces and evolve them for how people
live today, with smart construction and custom-
developed materials.
