<h2>Did I miss one????</h2>

<p>I will LOVE you if you submit a high-tier or mid-tier hoodie that I don't have!

Add your email here and please post a link to the hoodie.

<i>NOTE 1: There are millions of hoodies out there, I am mostly interested in high-end (>$100) and even some mid-tier (>$50) full-zip hoodies (with hoods, not regular sweatshirts).

If there is only a pullover version I can add them, but note that I would prefer tubular construction with a pullover which is generally going to only be high-end.

Typically I only will link to the classic 'full-zip heather-gray' version of the hoodie. Most retailers will have multiple colors, so please don't send links to every color. 

NOTE 2: as cool as some designer hoodies are, and yes I've seen some up to $3,000 for a hoodie, they are usually not heavy fabric and are at best 'mid-tier' unless made of loopwheeled cotton.  If they don't have a basic grey <srong>without</srong> print then I probably won't list them.

Thank you so much!
