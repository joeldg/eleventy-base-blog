<strong>Are people really so into hoodies they would pay more than $200 for one?</strong>

Yes and these types of hoodies are very often sold out in all the regular sizes as soon as they become available, so you will see you can buy one, but only in S, XXL or XXXL.

<p>This site of born from an lifelong obsession for hoodies, the idea for this site was started from a Reddit MFA guide from five years ago that you can see at the following link: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15v5ya/hirokis_mfa_guide_to_sweatshirts/">hirokis_mfa_guide_to_sweatshirts</a>

The thread has not really been updated and some of the links are out of date. Also, some of the companies are no long in business and then there are new ones. Additionally there are entire markets like the German loopwheel fabric hoodies that are ignored.
</p>
<p>My goal with this site is that I hope it helps with your search for the best hoodie in the world, or at least the best hoodie for your budget -or- for right now.</p>

<p>As a hoodie affectionado, I currently have about thirty hoodies and during a recent move I given away nearly twenty (yes, I had almost fifty hoodies). I have paid everything from $10 to over $200 for a hoodie. </p>

<p>hoodiehunt.com is a place for me to add new hoodies as I find them and to organize hoodies by tags so you can find the hoodie you are looking for.</p>
