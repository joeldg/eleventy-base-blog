<strong>Are people really so into hoodies they would pay more than $200 for a classic gray one?</strong>

Yes and these types of hoodies are very often sold out in all the regular sizes as soon as they become available, so you will see you can buy one, but only in S, XXL or XXXL.

<p>This site of born from an lifelong obsession for hoodies, the idea for this site was started from a Reddit MFA guide from five years ago that you can see at the following link: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15v5ya/hirokis_mfa_guide_to_sweatshirts/">hirokis_mfa_guide_to_sweatshirts</a>

The thread has not really been updated and some of the links are out of date. Also, some of the companies are no long in business and then there are new ones. Additionally there are entire markets like the German loopwheel fabric hoodies that are ignored.
</p>
<p>My goal with this site is that I hope it helps with your search for the best hoodie in the world, or at least the best hoodie for your budget -or- for right now.</p>

<p>As a hoodie affectionado, I currently have about thirty hoodies and during a recent move I given away nearly twenty (yes, I had almost fifty hoodies). I have paid everything from $10 to over $200 for a hoodie. </p>

<p>hoodiehunt.com is a place for me to add new hoodies as I find them and to organize hoodies by tags so you can find the hoodie you are looking for.</p>

## scoring    

Lets just start by saying that "None of the hoodies here are crap", I would wear anyt of them. That said, I have preferences and so my steep scoring system for how to tier a hoodie is as follows.

#### low-end
<strong>Typically $30-$120</strong>: The bottom rung here you may have a few of these blended cotton and polyester pieces in your front closet. The top rung are all order online and will be 100% cotton or high percentage cotton blends. Many of these are really great everyday hoodies that will last a long time, they just don't have the details needed for a mid-tier hoodie. 

The <a href='/toplists/'>top five</a> low end hoodies are the heaviest fabric of the bunch and are exceptional quality and value, they are worth it to get. If you are on a budget or just curious about this 'fancy hoodie' thing, start there, you will be plenty happy.

#### mid-tier
<strong>Typically over $100</strong>: Hoodies fitting into this tier are hoodies which are excellent in their own right and may cost over $200, they are made with thick fleece or terry and should be 100% cotton. Hoodies in this tier often will be 13oz fabric and have flatlocked seams and two-way zippers. These are typically really good quality with great details but are not loopwheeled cotton fabric which keeps them from being listed in the high-end. 

#### high-end
<strong>Typically over $200</strong>: These need to be loopwheeled cotton which has a specific feel and weight that makes these the best of the best. Loopwheeled cotton is all done on vintage machines which are only in two places in the world, Japan and Germany. These are the sweatshirts that make women hot and guys jealous. They are almost always sold out and you are probably going to have to order one of them from Japan. You want these and when you wear them, everyone else wants them too.
