<h4>Sign up for mailing lists for denim websites</h4>
You are going to notice when shopping for the hoodies that a lot of them are sold out. This is pretty common with loopwheel cotton sweats especially. You can sign up on the following sites to get updates on when new hoodies are added.

* <a href="https://www.superdenim.com/us/">Superdenim</a> - at the bottom of the page.
* <a href="https://blueingreensoho.com/">Blue in Green</a> - Click on 'subscribe' at the bottom.
* <a href="https://www.firmamentberlin.com/newsletter">Firmament</a> - Direct link
* <a href="https://www.mrporter.com">Mr. Porter</a> - In the footer.
* <a href="http://www.peggsandson.com/contacts/">Peggs and Son</a> - "Subscribe" button at bottom.
* <a href="https://reigningchamp.com/">Reigning Champ</a> - It should pop up.

Most of the sites will have newsletters, it's often worth it to sign up to get news on sales and for new and restocked products.


<h4>Yes, you can shop amazon.co.jp</h4>
Click <a href="https://ridwankhan.com/buying-and-shipping-using-amazon-co-jp-and-tenso-com-from-the-united-states-77f8ec62a92a">here</a> for some instructions. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xBgOdZxMUU">here is a video</a> showing how to do it.

<h4>Pay close attention to sizing charts.</h4>

Seriously, if you are buying a hoodie for hundreds of dollars, having it shipped half way around the world you should pay close attention to the sizing charts on the websites.

You will need to measure your chest/torso, arm length, shoulders and so on. I would suggest having a tailor measure you. One way to do this would be to go into a store like Jos. A Bank and have them measure you for a suit, or have someone with a cloth measuring tape help you out.

If you are from the U.S. and if they are in Japanese sizes, go way up, maybe two sizes.

<h4>Pay close attention to shrinkage notes.</h4>
Not all of these are pre-washed/shrunk, you may need to go up an additional size.
