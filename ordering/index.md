<h4>Pay close attention to sizing charts.</h4>
Seriously, if you are buying a hoodie for hundreds of dollars, pay close attention to the sizing charts on the websites.

You will need to measure your chest/torso, arm length, shoulders and so on. I would suggest having a tailor measure you. One way to do this would be to go into a store like Jos. A Bank and have them measure you for a suit, or have someone with a cloth measuring tape help you out.

If you are from the U.S. and if they are in Japanese sizes, go way up, maybe two sizes.

<h4>Pay close attention to shrinkage notes.</h4>
Not all of these are pre-washed/shrunk, you may need to go up an additional size.
