<h4>Yes, you can shop amazon.co.jp</h4>
Click <a href="https://ridwankhan.com/buying-and-shipping-using-amazon-co-jp-and-tenso-com-from-the-united-states-77f8ec62a92a">here</a> for some instructions. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xBgOdZxMUU">here is a video</a> showing how to do it.

<h4>Pay close attention to sizing charts.</h4>

Seriously, if you are buying a hoodie for hundreds of dollars, having it shipped half way around the world you should pay close attention to the sizing charts on the websites.

You will need to measure your chest/torso, arm length, shoulders and so on. I would suggest having a tailor measure you. One way to do this would be to go into a store like Jos. A Bank and have them measure you for a suit, or have someone with a cloth measuring tape help you out.

If you are from the U.S. and if they are in Japanese sizes, go way up, maybe two sizes.

<h4>Pay close attention to shrinkage notes.</h4>
Not all of these are pre-washed/shrunk, you may need to go up an additional size.
